# url-shortener

This project is built in go and lets the user shorten any api by hitting the end point: http://localhost:3000/api/shorten with a JSON post request.

Example:

{ "url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" }

There are settings already set up if any one wants to try it just clone this project and build the docker image with:
"Docker compose up -d"
